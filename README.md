# Find a Friend with Character!

This is a Friend Finding App where users are given questions and then provided with a match in the form of a gif of a celebrity or character in tv or music. The logic behind this game is that it takes the user's info and compares it to the characters answers. Whomever the user's answers match to, they will recieve a gif of that character. 

Express was used to handle the routing and it is deployed to [heroku](https://friend-finder-nu.herokuapp.com/) and/or you can install it on your local machine.

## About

Full Stack Webscraper with an Express server that uses Cheerio &Request to grab articles from NPR's the Record website section, and then stores them in a Mongodb database. The app gives you the option of saving and deleting articles from the database, and also gives you the option of writing notes related to the articles that you save. Data is dispersed using Handlebars and it was designed with the bootstrap 4 framework. It is deployed on [Heroku](https://npr-music-scraper.herokuapp.com/) and/or you can install it on your local machine.
